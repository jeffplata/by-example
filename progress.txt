This class-based view is analogous to the previous post_list view. Here, we are 
telling ListView to:
•  Use a specific QuerySet instead of retrieving all objects. Instead of defining 
a queryset attribute, we could have specified model = Post and Django 
would have built the generic Post.objects.all() QuerySet for us.
•  Use the context variable posts for the query results. The default variable is 
object_list if we don't specify any context_object_name.
•  Paginate the result displaying three objects per page.
•  Use a custom template to render the page. If we don't set a default template, 
ListView will use blog/post_list.html.
Now, open the urls.py file of your blog application, comment the previous  
post_list URL pattern, and add a new URL pattern using the PostListView  
class as follows:
